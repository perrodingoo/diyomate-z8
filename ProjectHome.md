Based on other projects and knowledge (thanks to the information found on the web about **Realtek 1283** chipset).

This "project" is mainly a bookmark for my self, but it might be useful for someone.

I started because my player - **Diyomate Z8** (based on Realtek 1283 chipset, 256 Mb RAM, CPU speed: about 400 MHz, architecture MIPS, supports up to 1080p HD Video and Adio, 5.1)  stopped to play Online Radio and YouTube scripts not play videos any more.
